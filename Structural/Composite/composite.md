### Composite:

* Composite is a class/module that can either be a single object or collection
* Some composed and singular object needs the same behavior/treatments
* Composite treats those two cases the same
* Javascript supports iteration with Symbol.iterator 
* A single object can make itself iterable by yielding this.
